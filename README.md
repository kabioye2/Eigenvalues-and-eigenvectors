# Eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors

Introduction
Eigenvalues are used to uncouple coupled systems to obtain a solution more easily. This
assignment focuses on solving for these systems by solving for eigenvalues and eigenvectors by
hand. When the values are found, they are verified in MATLAB. The solutions are then plotted
in MATLAB.

Conclusion
Repetitively solving for eigenvalues by hand has been effective in learning eigenvalue
decomposition. Coupled systems require all the equations to solve for all variables. By
uncoupling the equations, you can get a solution for each equation. For instance, the ways cells
communicate can be a coupled system.

Discussion
The use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors help solve for coupled systems which is important when
solving for biological systems.
